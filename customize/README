In this directory you can place your headers and footers
for almost any page in the Web interface AVReg:
   - upper (HEADER), the template RELDIR/BASE_header.inc.php
   - lower (FOOTER), template RELDIR/BASE_footer.inc.php
where:
  RELDIR - path part of a target page URL;
  BASE   - target page file name without the extension.

Example:
  target page URL - "/avreg/online/view.php"
  RELDIR = "online"
  BASE   = "view"
  HEADER = "online/view_header.inc.php"
  FOOTER = "online/view_footer.inc.php"

In the HEADER and FOOTER you can add arbitrary rectangular blocks
with your own text and images.
In the HEADER you can append/override the css-styles,
add your own scripts and even to redirect to another pages
(only from the main page).
